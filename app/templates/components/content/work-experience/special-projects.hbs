<p>I have been collaborating with Nico Athene, a feminist artist whose work speaks about the performativity of femininity and the male gaze. She is a performance artist whose work plays with the appropriation of the title 'artist', its relation to the title 'whore', and what it looks and sounds like to take agency as the sexualised female 'art' object. The collaboration has included local artists like Ed Young, Gavin Krastin, Dean Hutton and Robert Hamblin.</p>
<p>A project close to my heart is mentoring of a local artist, <a title="Chuma Somdaka" href="https://mynameischuma.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><em></em></a><a title="Chuma Somdaka" href="https://mynameischuma.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Chuma Somdaka</a>. She was previously homeless, but has received a scholarship and is now studying art.&nbsp;</p>
